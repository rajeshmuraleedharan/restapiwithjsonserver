More often front-end developers need to simulate a REST api service to deliver json data to front-end app or mock an external api while we do integration testing.  JSON Server is a simple project that helps to setup a REST API endpoint with CRUS operations very fast. Check this https://github.com/typicode/json-server to know more about JSON Server.

In this sample repo you can learn about to setup JSON Server and publish as static JSON file as a REST API. Also generate fake data on the fly using Faker.js and expose REST api.
