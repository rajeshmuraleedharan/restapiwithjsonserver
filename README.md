# Rest api with json server
Create A REST API With JSON Server(json-server) and Mocking Data with Faker.js

https://hub.docker.com/r/rajeshmuraleedharan/restapiwithjsonserver/


More often front-end developers need to simulate a REST api service to deliver json data to front-end app or mock an external api while we do integration testing.  JSON Server is a simple project that helps to setup a REST API endpoint with CRUS operations very fast. Check this https://github.com/typicode/json-server to know more about JSON Server.

In this sample repo you can learn about to setup JSON Server and publish as static JSON file as a REST API. Also generate fake data on the fly using Faker.js and expose REST api. Finally dockerize the app.

Note: I have used Visual Studio Code to create this project

# Step 1
Create a package.json file that describes your app and its dependencies
